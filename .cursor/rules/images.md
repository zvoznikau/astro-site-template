# Image and Visual Context Rules

**Status**:
- **Type**: Mandatory addition
- **Applies to**: All landings
- **Goal**: Remove "sterile black/white" and add liveliness without visual noise

**Related documents**: See `.cursor/rules/design-vision-2026.md` for design vision

## 1. General Principle for Working with Images

### Main Rule

**Images are context, not decoration.**

They:
- ❌ Do NOT explain the product
- ❌ Do NOT compete with text
- ❌ Do NOT "decorate"

They:
- ✅ Create a sense of modern, living product
- ✅ Add depth and emotion
- ✅ Work as background or support meaning

---

## 2. What Images to Use

### Allowed and Recommended

#### 2.1 Product Screenshots
- Real screenshots of application / service
- Without device frames
- Without iPhone mockups (unless App-centric landing)
- Allowed:
  - Slightly cropped
  - Use fragments

#### 2.2 Abstract Tech Images (Stock)
- Soft
- Neutral
- Without people in close-up
- Without "office smiles"

Example themes:
- Abstract graphs
- Server racks (not 2008 datacenter)
- Interfaces, blur, depth
- "Technology without faces"

#### 2.3 Ambient Backgrounds
- Light noise
- Soft gradients
- Textures
- Used VERY sparingly

## 3. Forbidden Images

**Strictly forbidden:**
- ❌ People in office, looking at screen
- ❌ "Happy team", "startup meeting"
- ❌ Hand-shake, coffee, laptop on table
- ❌ Stock photos level 2015
- ❌ Illustrations "like Notion 2020"

**If an image looks like:**

> "We empower teams to innovate"

**— it is forbidden.**

## 4. Where to Use Images (Structure)

### 4.1 Hero

**Allowed:**
- One image
- Either product screenshot
- Or abstract tech visual

**Requirements:**
- Image must not break text
- Text is always primary
- On mobile, image can go below

### 4.2 Between Blocks (Visual Pauses)

**Very important.**

**Tasks:**
- Insert images between semantic blocks
- Use as "breathing", not as content

**Example:**
```
Hero
→ image
→ Features
→ image
→ Pricing
```

### 4.3 Features / How it works

**Allowed:**
- 1–2 supporting images
- Very calm
- Not near every feature

**Forbidden:**
- Icon + image + text in one place

---

## 5. Color and Image Processing

### Mandatory Requirements
- Images must not be too contrasty
- Desirable:
  - Slightly muted
  - Or with overlay
- Images must not pull attention away from text

### Light / Dark:
- Images must "live" equally in both themes
- If necessary — different versions

---

## 6. Image Sources (Allowed)

For MVP, links are allowed, without uploading assets.

**Allowed stocks:**
- Unsplash
- Pexels
- StockSnap
- Apple marketing assets (if applicable)

**Forbidden:**
- Shutterstock-style paid stock
- Overly generic SaaS illustrations

---

## 7. Rules for Cursor Agents (Update)

**Cursor agent:**
- ✅ Must provide places for images
- ✅ Must NOT make site completely text-only
- ✅ Must NOT select "people from office"

**Agent must:**
- Leave image slots
- Label image purpose (context / product / ambient)
- NOT insert images inside text blocks without necessity

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria (Update)

**Site is NOT accepted if:**
- Completely black and white
- Looks like documentation
- No visual context at all

**Site is accepted if:**
- Visually "breathes"
- Images do not interfere with text
- Site looks modern and alive
- Reminds cursor.com / gitkraken.com, not Notion docs
